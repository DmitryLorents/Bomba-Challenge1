## Swift Marathon 8.0 Challenge-1 Team #7
In this project, Challenge Bomba1, the main goal is to learn how to work in a team and interact, come to common guidelines and work with the help of a version control system

## What you will create
We created a game called "Bomb" for example, an application from the AppStore was taken and we started to do our own using the example of a ready-made one and showed maximum initiative, dividing a large task into small ones and got an excellent result from the weekly challenge
